      The Devon Rex is a breed of intelligent, tall-eared, short-haired cat that
      emerged in England during the late 1950s. They are known for their slender
      bodies, wavy coat, and large ears. This breed of cat is capable of
      learning difficult tricks but can be hard to motivate. The Devon Rex is a
      breed of cat with a curly, very soft short coat similar to that of the
      Cornish Rex. They are often thought of as one of the most hypoallergenic
      cats available because of their type of coat. However, they are
      technically not hypoallergenic. The first Devon was discovered by Beryl
      Cox in Buckfastleigh, Devon, UK, in 1959. The breed was initially thought
      to be linked with the Cornish Rex; however, test mating proved otherwise.
      Hair Cats have three types of hair: guard hair, awn hair, and down hair.
      The Devon Rex's coat is unusual because there is little guard hair. (See
      Cornish Rex and Sphynx for more information on hair-deficient genetics in
      cats.) The curl in Devon Rex fur is caused by a different mutation and
      gene than that of the Cornish Rex and German Rex, and breeding of a Devon
      with either of those cats results in cats without rexed (curled) fur.
      Devons, which are medium-sized cats, are often called "pixie cats" because
      of their unique appearance. Other characteristics Their uncommonly large,
      slightly rounded ears are set low on the sides of their wide heads, their
      eyes are large, and their noses are slightly upturned. Unlike most cats,
      their whiskers are very short and often curled to such an extent that it
      may appear as if they have no whiskers. Their body type is distinctly
      lightly built. Their long, sturdy legs are well suited for long leaps, and
      their toes are unusually large. Personality The typical Devon is active,
      mischievous, playful, and very people-orientated. They have been described
      as a cross between a cat, a dog and a monkey[1] (or, more famously, as "a
      monkey in a cat suit"). They are high-jumpers and will try to occupy any
      space large enough to admit them. With this trait, they are often found in
      odd nooks and crannies of a closet, shelf, or laundry basket. Devons
      prefer to be in high places and will go to great lengths to get to the
      highest spot in a room. They are relatively easy to take care of. Most
      Devons also have one central person to whom they devote their love, and on
      whom they will most often lie and rub.[citation needed] They like to
      playfully nip, and love to play throughout their lives. They are a very
      intelligent breed; the typical Devon Rex can be trained to walk on a
      leash, fetch or perform all manner of tricks usually associated with
      canines, like jump, heel and tag to name a few.[1] Another common trait is
      their show of affection: they have a particular penchant for being close
      to the head or neck of their human companions and can often be found
      mounted upon one's shoulder or nestled into the cranny created by the neck
      and shoulder when one is prone. The Devon Rex is a faithful companion and
      will usually follow the object of their affection from room to room,
      waiting for the opportunity to leap onto their arms, lap, or shoulder.
