    <p>The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky
        body, dense coat, and cute broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid
        grey-blue
        coat, orange eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and
        patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.
        The breed's good-natured appearance and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the
        inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. The Cat Fanciers'
        Association profile reads: "When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly
        recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'."</p>
