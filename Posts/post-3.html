    <p>The Norwegian Forest cat (Norwegian: Norsk skogkatt and Norsk skaukatt) is a breed of domestic cat originating in
        Northern Europe. This natural breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with a top coat of long, glossy,
        water-shedding hair and a woolly undercoat for insulation. The breed's ancestors may have been a landrace of
        short-haired cats brought to Norway about A.D. 1000 by the Vikings, who may also have brought with them long-haired
        cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora. During World War II, the Norwegian Forest cat
        was
        nearly extinct; then the Norwegian Forest Cat Club's breeding program increased the cat's number. It was registered
        as a
        breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane,
        took
        notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. The breed is very popular in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland,
        and
        France.The Norwegian Forest cat is strongly built and larger than an average cat. Adult females weigh 3.6–8 kg (8–18 lbs);
        males, 4.5–9 kg (10–20 lbs). The breed has a long, sturdy body; long legs; and a bushy tail. The coat consists of a
        long, thick, glossy, water-repellent top layer and a woolly undercoat and is thickest at the legs, chest, and head.[7]
        The undercoat appears as a ruff. The profile of the breed is generally straight.[10] Their water-resistant coat with a
        dense undercoat developed to help the cat survive in the harsh Scandinavian climate</p>
