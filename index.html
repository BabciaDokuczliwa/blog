<p>The Devon Rex is a breed of intelligent, tall-eared, short-haired cat that emerged in England during the late 1950s. They are known for their slender bodies, wavy coat, and large ears. This breed of cat is capable of learning difficult tricks but can be hard to motivate.</p>

 <h2>British Shorthair</h2>

<div class="BritishShorthair">
<p>The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky
body, dense coat, and cute broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue
coat, orange eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and
patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.
The breed's good-natured appearance and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the
inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. The Cat Fanciers'
Association profile reads: "When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly
recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'."</p>

<h2>Norwegian Forest cat</h2>

    <div class="Norwegian">
    <p>The Norwegian Forest cat (Norwegian: Norsk skogkatt and Norsk skaukatt) is a breed of domestic cat originating in
    Northern Europe. This natural breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with a top coat of long, glossy,
    water-shedding hair and a woolly undercoat for insulation. The breed's ancestors may have been a landrace of
    short-haired cats brought to Norway about A.D. 1000 by the Vikings, who may also have brought with them long-haired
    cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora. During World War II, the Norwegian Forest cat was
    nearly extinct; then the Norwegian Forest Cat Club's breeding program increased the cat's number. It was registered as a
    breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took
    notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. The breed is very popular in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and
    France.</p></div>
